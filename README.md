# Project Todos

Week 11 at technigo bootcamp. This weeks project was to create a to-do list in Redux. The tasks should be possible to add, remove, check and be counted by a counter that keeps track of how many task the list contains.

## The problem

This is the third week of using Redux and after this week it feels more clear how to use it.
In this project I have got better knowledge in:
✓ The role redux-toolkit plays
✓ How to create new slices
✓ How to create new reducers
✓ How to create new actions
✓ What immutability means and how to work with it
✓ How to structure a redux store
✓ How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions
