# Project Todos

Week 11 at technigo bootcamp. This weeks project was to create a to-do list in Redux. The tasks should be possible to add, remove, check and be counted by a counter that keeps track of how many task the list contains.

## The problem

This is the third week of using Redux and after this week it feels more clear how to use it.
In this project I have got better knowledge in the role redux-toolkit plays, how to create new slices, reducers and new actions.
I learned how to structure a redux store and to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions
